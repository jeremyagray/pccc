What is pccc?
=============

pccc is a PyParsing based grammar and script for parsing and verifying
a commit message is a conventional commit.  The default grammar
follows the `specification
<https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification>`_, but
allows for the definition of types in addition to ``feat`` and ``fix``
and for the definition of project specific scopes and footers in
compliance with the specification.  The maximum line lengths of the
commit header and commit body and spelling can also be checked.

Currently, the script interface will load configuration options and a
commit message and attempt to parse it.  If there are no parse
exceptions, it will return 0, otherwise 1.  This interface should be
usable at the git ``commit-msg`` hook stage now.  It can also be
configured to ignore certain automatically generated commits (from
``git pull`` for instance) if it is not desirable or possible to
generate those commits as conventional commits (preferable).

Roadmap
=======

#. Implement complete interoperability with TOML and JSON for
   configuration. (target: 0.5.0)

   * ``Config().__str__()`` should output either format (finished: 0.4.3)
   * streamline testing fixture data formats

#. Finish body and breaking change wrapping. (target: 0.5.0)

   * configuration option for fields to check
   * create body length, header length, and breaking change line
     length validation functions for validation mode
   * rewrap if configured, otherwise do nothing for reformatting mode

#. Implement spell checking. (target: 0.5.0)

   * create spelling validation function for validation mode
   * if enabled, mirror raw commit and questionable words to standard
     output and return a non-zero exit code
   * questionable words will be ignored by adding the words to the
     commented ``ignore-spelling: `` field
     (``r"^\s*#\s*ignore-spelling:\s+``).

#. Implement simple output reformatting, with configuration options
   and validation functions, operating in the validation/reformatting
   mode described previously.  (target: 0.6.0)

   * footer separator as ": " or " #"
   * "BREAKING-CHANGE" or "BREAKING CHANGE"
   * set breaking flag (!) and/or "BREAKING-CHANGE"
   * correct token capitalization ("BREAKING-CHANGE" not
     "breaking-change" or "Breaking-Change"; "Signed-off-by" not
     "Signed-Off-By" or "signed-off-by")

#. Implement partial parsing on failure for correction and improved
   exception handling. (target: 0.7.0 or later)

   * header partial parsing
   * body partial parsing
   * breaking change partial parsing
   * footer partial parsing

#. Feature freeze, strict semantic versioning, and finish alpha and
   beta. (from 0.7.0 onward; first stable will be at 1.0.0)

#. Implement custom hooks for handling per-project footers. (target:
   2.0.0 or later)

#. Integrate ``argparse`` help into documentation. (finished: 0.3.3)
#. Insert license information into all source files. (finished: 0.3.3)
#. Complete upload and build for setuptools/pip and poetry. (finished:
   0.3.3; poetry is configured but not used)
#. Complete documentation integration and upload at Read The
   Docs. (finished: 0.3.3)
#. Github issue template based off current ``tests/parser/*.json``
   files, with guidelines. (finished: 0.3.3)
#. JSON configuration support, via ``pccc`` entry in
   ``package.json``. (finished: 0.3.3)
#. 100% test coverage, with tests implemented before
   merging. (finished: 0.3.4)
#. Add and configure tox. (finished: 0.4.0)
#. Split validation and reformatting.  Validation will be the default
   mode and will be active with no repair options set.  Validation
   will exit with a return status of 0 or 1 only for use as a git
   commit-msg hook and will mirror the commit message unchanged to
   standard output on failure.  Reformatting will be active if repair
   options are set.  It will exit with return status 0 if the commit
   is already valid, otherwise it will exit with return status 1 and
   print the reformatted commit to standard output for the user to
   inspect.  (finished: 0.4.2)


Installation
============

Install pccc with::

  pip install pccc
  pip freeze > requirements.txt

or add as a poetry dev-dependency.

If you desire a package locally built with poetry, download the
source, change the appropriate lines in ``pyproject.toml``, and
rebuild.

To use as a git ``commit-msg`` hook, copy the script ``pccc`` to
``.git/hooks/commit-msg`` and set the file as executable or integrate
the script or module into your existing ``commit-msg`` hook.  ``pccc``
relies on ``git`` setting the current working directory of the script
to the root of the repository (where ``pyproject.toml`` or
``package.json`` typically lives).  If this is not the repository
default, pass the configuration file path as an argument or symlink
from the current working directory to an appropriate configuration
file.

Usage
=====

Console::

  pccc COMMIT_MSG
  cat COMMIT_MSG | pccc

In Python::

  >>> import pccc
  >>> ccr = pccc.ConventionalCommitRunner()
  >>> ccr.options.load()
  >>> ccr.raw = "some commit message"
  >>> ccr.clean()
  >>> ccr.parse()
  >>> if ccr.exc == None:
  ...     print(ccr)

See the source and `documentation
<https://pccc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for more information.

Configuration
=============

See ``pccc.toml`` for an example ``[tool.pccc]`` section that may be
copied into a ``pyproject.toml`` file.  The same entries may be used
in a ``pccc`` entry in ``package.json`` for JavaScript/TypeScript
projects.
